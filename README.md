# DMOJ solutions

DMOJ is the online judge I used to practise completing competitive programming quesitons for the <b><i>Canadian Computing Competition (CCC)</b></i> run by the University of Waterloo for Secondary School Students

Solutions to most problems require non-trivial <b><i>Data Structures and Algorithms </b></i> including but not limited to Dynamic Programming, Dijkstra's, Binary Indexed Trees, and Segment Trees.

Each folder points to one question on DMOJ

Includes all my solutions that I have submitted to DMOJ while practising for programming contests

Every question is located at one folder, and may have multiple solutions in different languages, or have solutions that are unfinished (not completely correct)
